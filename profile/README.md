# NPIOcean data

GitHub page for ``NPIOcean``, the Oceanography section of the [Norwegian Polar Institute](https://www.npolar.no/en/).

This is a place for sharing and developing code and documentation. 

Initially mainly for internal use, but aiming to use this as a platform for sharing with the wider community.
